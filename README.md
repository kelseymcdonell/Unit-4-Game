# Unit-4-Game

The Crystal Collector game presents the user with a random number. Each crystal also has a random value. The user clicks on the crystals until they add up to the random number that the game initially presented. If the user's total matches the random number, the user wins. If the user's total goes over the random number, the user loses. After a win or loss, all of the random variables reset.
